//! `surface_mesh` must not fold. A road surface is Z-up and its banking is
//! gentle, so every non-degenerate triangle faces up. A downward-facing one is
//! an inverted bowtie where the inner rib crossed itself. Two shapes cause it,
//! and both are guarded. A stub segment a few cm long at a lane-section joint
//! tessellates to a near-collinear sliver whose winding flips. A corner tighter
//! than the lane half-width lets the inner offset push past the curve's center.
