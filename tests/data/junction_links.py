"""Generate junction_links.xodr: incoming roads whose <link> leaves out their junction.

    python3 tests/data/junction_links.py

Every road is a flat straight with 3.5 m driving lanes 1 and -1, and lane
links on the connecting roads only.

Road 1 runs 50 m along +X from the origin and has no <link>. Road 2 runs
50 m on from (60, 0), with junction 5 as its predecessor. Connecting road
10, in junction 5, runs the 10 m between them: its predecessor is road 1's
end, and its successor road 2's start. Junction 5 connects road 1 into road
10 at its start, lane -1 to -1, and road 2 into road 10 at its end, lane 1
to 1.

Road 3 runs 50 m along +X from (0, 30), with an empty <link>. Connecting
road 11, in junction 6, runs 10 m on from (50, 30) and names no road at
either end. Junction 6 connects road 3 into road 11 at its start, lane -1
to -1.
