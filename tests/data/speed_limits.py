"""Generate speed_limits.xodr: road types and speed limits on roads and lanes.

    python3 tests/data/speed_limits.py

Every road is a flat straight heading +X, with 3.5 m driving lanes.

Road 0, 100 m from the origin, has one lane section and lanes 1, -1 and
-2. It is a town road at 50 km/h from s = 0, a motorway with no limit from
s = 30, and a rural road at 60 mph from s = 60. Lane -2 has its own
`<speed>`s: 20 with no unit from sOffset 10, and 30 km/h from sOffset 40.

Road 1, 40 m from (0, 20), has lane sections at s = 0 and s = 20, and
lane -1 in both. Its only type is a town road from s = 5, with
`max="undefined"`. Lane -1 has a `<speed>` of 10 m/s in the first
section only.

Road 2, 20 m from (0, 40), has lane -1. Its type is `highway`, which the
spec does not name, with a `<speed>` in `kmh`. Lane -1 has a `<speed>`
with `max="fast"`.
