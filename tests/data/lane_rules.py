"""Generate lane_rules.xodr: lane <rule>s, <access>es and <material>s.

    python3 tests/data/lane_rules.py

Road 0 is a 100 m straight heading +X, with lane sections at s = 0 and
s = 60, and 3.5 m lanes 1, -1 and -2 in each.

In the first section:

- Lane -1 has the rule "no stopping at any time" from 0 and "car pool"
  from 30, with a <rule> without a value at 40 between. It is open to
  buses and taxis only from 0, in 1.8 <restriction>s, until a deny of
  "none" at 40 lifts that. Its surface is asphalt with friction 0.9 and
  roughness 0.002 from 0, then gravel with friction 0.6 from 20.
- Lane -2 denies trucks and bicycles from 10, in two <access>es in the
  form before 1.8, then has an <access> at 30 without a rule. Its
  <material>s at 25 and 5 are out of order.
- Lane 1, against +s, has the rule "disabled parking" from 0 and
  "no stopping at any time" from 20.

The second section has none of them.
