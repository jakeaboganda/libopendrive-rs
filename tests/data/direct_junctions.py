"""Generate direct_junctions.xodr: roads joined end to end by direct junctions.

    python3 tests/data/direct_junctions.py

Every road is a flat straight with 3.5 m driving lanes and no lane links.

Road 0 runs 50 m along +X from the origin, with lanes 1, -1 and -2. Its
successor is direct junction 8. Road 1 carries on from (50, 0) with lanes
1 and -1, and road 2 bends off to the right from (50, -3.5), heading
-0.3 rad, with lane -1. Both have junction 8 as predecessor. Junction 8
links road 0 into road 1, lanes 1 to 1 and -1 to -1, and into road 2,
lane -2 to -1. It gives no connection back out of roads 1 and 2. Its third
connection has no `linkedRoad`.

Roads 3 and 4 do the same from (0, 20), lanes 1 and -1, through direct
junction 9, which gives the connection both ways.

Junction 10 is a common junction whose only connection has no
`connectingRoad`.
