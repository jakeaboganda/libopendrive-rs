"""Generate road_neighbors.xodr: roads that name the road beside them.

    python3 tests/data/road_neighbors.py

Roads 1, 2 and 3 are flat 50 m straights, each with a 3.5 m driving lane
-1. Road 1 heads +X from the origin. Road 2 heads +X from (0, 5), on road
1's left, and road 3 heads -X from (50, -5), on road 1's right, running
the other way. Road 1's <link> names road 2 on its left in the same
direction, and road 3 on its right in the opposite one. Road 2's names road
1 on its right, and a road 9 the file doesn't have. Road 3's names road 1
with a side of "up", which the element doesn't allow.

<neighbor> is from OpenDRIVE 1.4. 1.9 no longer has it.
