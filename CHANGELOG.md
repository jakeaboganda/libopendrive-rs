# Changelog

## 0.1.0 -- unreleased

First release. Extracted from a simulator that had grown it in-tree, and
reworked for standalone use.

### Imports

- Reference geometry: `line`, `arc`, `spiral` (clothoid), `paramPoly3`,
  `poly3`.
- `<elevationProfile>`, and `<lateralProfile>` superelevation baked as a real
  cant about the reference line.
- Per-lane widths, `laneOffset`, and multiple lane sections.
- Road/lane `<link>`s and `<junction>`s, resolved into a drive-direction lane
  graph.

### Queries

- `nearest_lane`, `sample_near`, and `route` over the lane graph.
- `surface_mesh` tessellation, with `Mesh::validate` and `Mesh::height_at`.

### Changes since the in-tree version

- `RoadNetwork`'s lane list is private behind `new()` and `lanes()`, so the
  network can index itself with no way for the index to go stale.
- `nearest_lane` and the new `Mesh::sampler` answer off a ground-plane grid
  rather than scanning the map. On Town07: `nearest_lane` 67x faster,
  `sample_near` 64x, `route` 4.7x, `height_at` 168x.
- `Mesh::height_at` no longer reports a `NaN` height for a query far enough
  out to overflow its barycentric arithmetic.
- `Mesh` carries a `LaneSpan` per lane, naming the slice of the buffers that
  lane contributed.
- Optional `serde` feature for the network and its mesh.

### Not yet

`<lateralProfile>` `<shape>` (per-`t` crowning and camber), lane types other
than `driving`, and visualization.
